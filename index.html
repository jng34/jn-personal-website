            <p>Life has gone full circle. I first started my own personal blog called <em>"NATURALIGNMENT"</em> back in 2014 
        when I was aspiring to be a health coach. I dabbled with HTML and CSS through Wordpress, which made life a bit easier for me.
        However, I still had to Google the basics and nevertheless learned a good amount from the project. Fast forward
        8 years later, here I am creating a website from scratch.</p>
