        However, I still had to <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> the basics and nevertheless learned a good amount from the project. Fast forward
        8 years later, here I am creating a website from scratch. My goal is to continue to spread the message about living a healthy, compassionate life through the use of technology.
